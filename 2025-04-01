Clients requet data from servers
+Servers provide data to clients
+Every device acts as either a client or server
+Client Server networks provide centralised control
+But servers can be expensive and difficult to run

Peer to peer 
+have no central servers 
+Individual devices can switch between being clients and servers 
+Each computer is equal in responsibility 
+Simpler to set up and maintain but no manager securit or backups

Lan Topology 
+ It belong to layer 1 or physical layer or the osi model 
+ Physcial, Logical, and Hybrid 
8 different topologies 
+Point-to-point topology 
+Point-to-multipoint topology 
+Bus Topology (Daisy Chain Topology)
+Ring Topology - Each node reads the data and forwards it to the next node. 
+Star Topology has benefits overboth bus and ring 
+Hybrid topology 
  + Star-Ring (Star - Wired Ring)
  + Star-bus (mot common topology) 
+Partially Meshed Topology 
+Fully Meshed Topology (C=n(n-1)/2 | Best Top
