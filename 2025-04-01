Clients requet data from servers
+Servers provide data to clients
+Every device acts as either a client or server
+Client Server networks provide centralised control
+But servers can be expensive and difficult to run

Peer to peer 
+have no central servers 
+Individual devices can switch between being clients and servers 
+Each computer is equal in responsibility 
+Simpler to set up and maintain but no manager securit or backups

Lan Topology 
+ It belong to layer 1 or physical layer or the osi model 
+ Physcial, Logical, and Hybrid 
8 different topologies 
+Point-to-point topology 
+Point-to-multipoint topology 
+Bus Topology (Daisy Chain Topology)
+Ring Topology - Each node reads the data and forwards it to the next node. 
+Star Topology has benefits overboth bus and ring 
+Hybrid topology 
  + Star-Ring (Star - Wired Ring)
  + Star-bus (mot common topology) 
+Partially Meshed Topology 
+Fully Meshed Topology (C=n(n-1)/2 | Best Top

Data Encapsulation
Data is called a segment if UTC is used; called a datagram if UDP is used. 
At the data link layer the frame header is added and the end point is added as well.

De-encapsulation 
Destination side the recieving node will interprets and checks at the data link layer, delivering up to the network layer. 
Examination happens through the various layers, passing back up the chain through the layer toward the first later, the application layer.
