Twisted Pair Cable 
4 color-coded insukated copper wire pairs:
Shielded Twisted Pair
+ Braided Shielding, Jacket/Shield, Foil Shielding, Insulator
STP , UTP can transmit at the same rate. 
It dependson other factors such as levels of cable category, etc.

Fiber-Optic Cable 
Single Mode: 9 microns, High transfer rate over long distance, laser generated
Multi-Mode: Short distances, light distances over multiple paths, contains core 

Structure of Fiber-Optic Cable 
Jacket: Protects inner components
Buffer: USed to encapsulate one or more optiocal fibers providing protection from physical damage
Cladding: The glass or plastic shield around the core. 
Cores: 62.5 um , 50 um, 9 um 

Copper Cabling: 10 Gpersecond
