# Expansion Slots
Expansion slots are used to install various components (e.g., network cards, sound cards).

- **PCI Slots**
- **PCI-X**
- **PCI-E (Used today)**
  - Flavors: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x

### Data Cable Ports
- **IDE cable port (ribbon cable)** - Plugs into hard drive.

### Platform Controller HUB
- **North Bridge** (Now embedded into CPU) - Connected to CPU.
- **South Bridge** was replaced by **Platform Controller**.

---

# CHIP
- Controls different functions and stores certain data.
- Many chips have been reduced to **CHIPSET**, which manages data flow between the processor.

---

# BIOS vs UEFI
- **Firmware** is hardware with software embedded in it.
- **BIOS** is the firmware that comes with your motherboard.
- Hardware and software-based.

---

# CMOS Chip
- **UEFI (NEW)** replaced the old BIOS.
  - User-friendly interface.
  - Recognizes larger storage.
  - Built-in security features to stop unsigned drivers from loading.
  - Protects against malicious software (e.g., rootkits) with **Secure Boot**.

# 32-bit vs 64-bit
- **64-bit is better** for modern computing.

---

# RAM & Storage
### Processor Manufacturers
- **Intel** and **AMD** are the top manufacturers of CPUs.

### Computer Buses
Think of buses as data lines carrying information through the motherboard. They include power lines and control lines.

- **System Bus / Data Bus** - Carries data (RAM, USB).
- **Address Bus** - 8 wires = 8 bits; carries memory addresses, travels in one direction (unilateral).
- **Control Bus** - Controls and monitors signals; used by CPU to communicate with devices.
- **Internal Bus** - Enables communication within internal components.
- **External Bus** - Allows communication with hard drives.
- **Expansion Bus** - Connects CPU to PCI.

---

# Storage (Persistent)
- Can be **internal or external**.
- **Technology vs. Interface**:
  - **Magnetic Storage**: Uses spinning platters (e.g., HDDs).
  - **Solid State Storage (SSD)**: No moving parts (Best choice).
  - **Hybrid Storage**: Combination of HDD + SSD (seen in cloud environments).

### Interface (Connector/Input)
- **PATA (Parallel IDE)** - Ribbon cable connects storage to motherboard.
- **SCSI** - Ribbon cable supporting multiple drives.
- **SATA (Serial ATA)** - Smaller, faster than PATA.
- **NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)** - Eliminates cables, mounted directly on the motherboard.
- **USB Storage** - External solid-state storage.

# Storage Technology & Transfer Rates

| Type | Connector | Transfer Rate |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **NVMe (SSD)** | M.2 - SSD (NVMe Express) | 3GB/s |
| **SATA (Serial ATA)** | AHCI | 600 MB/s |
